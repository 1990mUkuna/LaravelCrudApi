To create Database and table in laravel We use "Migrations"

What is Migrations: is a way to version control tables

Commands to migrate table
: php artisan make:migration create_products_table

After updating the migrated table with the column
-> php artisan migrate

Note: To Rolback your migration or to edit
->php artisan migrate:rollback

->php artisan migrate

Go to env. t setup your Database name where the table must me migrated 

Run php artisan migrate

******* Setting up Controller and Routes ***********************

Model : Interact with the database Tables
Controller: We define Application Logic


To crate Controller:
-> php artisan make:controller ProductController 
-> php artisan make:controller ProductController --resource
Note: Resource will add all the crud functions

Note: In order to access the controller you need to routes 

-> Go to routes
-> api.php "Here is where you define all api routes"

Note: Now to check that your Controller is connected with the routes, echo inside show method
      Go to postman

****Create Model **************

Not: Model Naming Conventions.
     Model         -       Table 
     Product       -       products 
     User          -       users

Create Model
-> php artisan make:model Product
